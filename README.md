CS3505 Assignment 8: Pixel Sprite Editor
Authors: Jack Umina, Natalie Wilkins, Neeraja Vasa, Rowan Murdock

This project is a pixel-art style sprite editor, allowing for users to change one pixel at a time on a frame and then play it as an animation. 
The extra features we have decided to put into our sprite editor are a button that allows users to create a copy of the current frame they have
drawn in order to make the animation process smoother, as well as an undo button to allow for user to make mistakes and correct them easily.
